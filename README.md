# 🎓 Student Database Analysis using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
SQL project for analyzing student performance data using **MySQL** with tables, queries, and ER diagram.  
The database contains tables for students, subjects, attendance, and grades.  
SQL queries are written to analyze performance through **joins, aggregations, subqueries, and views**.
